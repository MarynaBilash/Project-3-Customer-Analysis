# Project-3-Customer-Analysis
**Description:**

This repository contains code and analysis for exploring and segmenting customer data from a marketing campaign. The project focuses on understanding customer behavior, identifying patterns, and segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and interactions with marketing campaigns.

**Key Features:**
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and content of the dataset. Various preprocessing steps are applied, including handling missing values, converting data types, and deriving new features.
2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving important information. This helps in visualizing high-dimensional data and identifying underlying patterns.
3. .Clustering Analysis: Clustering techniques such as KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering are used to segment customers into clusters based on their characteristics and behavior. Elbow method and visualization techniques are employed to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Visualization and Interpretation: Visualizations such as scatter plots, count plots, and boxen plots are utilized to explore relationships between variables, analyze cluster profiles, and understand spending behavior across different segments.
5. Insights and Recommendations: The analysis provides insights into customer segments, spending patterns, and promotional effectiveness. These insights can be used to tailor marketing strategies, target specific customer groups, and optimize promotional campaigns.

**Summary:**

**Cluster Number 0:**
1. Predominantly comprises parents, including single parents.
2. Typically consists of families with a maximum of four members and at least two members.
3. Teenagers are prevalent within households.
4. Customers in this cluster tend to be relatively older.
   
**Cluster Number 1:**
1. Majority are parents, with smaller family sizes.
2. Many households have one child.
3. Customers in this cluster tend to be relatively younger.

**Cluster Number 2:**
1. Does not include parents.
2. Typically consists of smaller households with a maximum of two members.
3. Comprises mostly couples or single individuals.
4. Spans across various age groups.
5. Represents a higher-income group.
   
**Cluster Number 3:**
1. Comprises predominantly parents with larger families, ranging up to five members.
2. Teenagers are common within households.
3. Customers in this cluster tend to be relatively older.
4. Represents a lower-income group.
   
These insights offer a comprehensive understanding of the diverse customer segments within the dataset, facilitating targeted marketing strategies and personalized campaigns tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each cluster.
