# Project-3-Customer-Analysis
**Description:**

This repository contains code and analysis for exploring and segmenting customer data from a marketing campaign. The project focuses on understanding customer behavior, identifying patterns, and segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics and interactions with marketing campaigns.

**Key Features:**
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and content of the dataset. Various preprocessing steps are applied, including handling missing values, converting data types, and deriving new features.
2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving important information. This helps in visualizing high-dimensional data and identifying underlying patterns.
3. .Clustering Analysis: Clustering techniques such as KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering are used to segment customers into clusters based on their characteristics and behavior. Elbow method and visualization techniques are employed to determine the optimal number of clusters.
4. Visualization and Interpretation: Visualizations such as scatter plots, count plots, and boxen plots are utilized to explore relationships between variables, analyze cluster profiles, and understand spending behavior across different segments.
5. Insights and Recommendations: The analysis provides insights into customer segments, spending patterns, and promotional effectiveness. These insights can be used to tailor marketing strategies, target specific customer groups, and optimize promotional campaigns.
